# depression_dataset_analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset related to depression, with the goal of understanding patterns and factors associated with depression. The dataset includes various features such as demographic information, lifestyle habits, and mental health status, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of the factors contributing to depression.

## Dataset
- **Source:** The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, titled [The Depression Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonytherrien/depression-dataset).
- **Features:** The dataset includes demographic details (age, gender, etc.), lifestyle habits (physical activity, diet, etc.), and mental health indicators (depression scores, anxiety levels, etc.).

## Analysis Techniques
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial exploration to understand the distribution of data and identify any missing values or anomalies.
- **Visualization:** Utilization of plots and charts to visualize relationships and patterns within the data. Common techniques include histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different features and their impact on depression.

## Problem Statement
The primary problem this analysis aims to address is identifying the key factors that contribute to depression. By understanding these factors, interventions can be designed to mitigate the risk of depression in various populations.

## Scenario
In a real-world scenario, a mental health organization might use this analysis to develop targeted prevention and intervention programs. For example, if physical inactivity is found to be strongly correlated with depression, the organization could create initiatives to promote physical activity among high-risk groups.

## Model and Algorithm
For building a predictive model to classify or predict depression based on the dataset, the following approach can be considered:

- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression or Random Forest can be suitable for classification tasks. These algorithms are chosen due to their interpretability and effectiveness in handling both numerical and categorical data.
  - **Logistic Regression:** This is a simple yet powerful algorithm for binary classification problems. It provides clear insights into the relationship between predictors and the outcome.
  - **Random Forest:** This ensemble method is robust and can handle complex interactions between features. It also provides feature importance scores, which can be valuable for understanding the key drivers of depression.

## Implementation
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.
2. **Model Training:** Split the data into training and testing sets, train the selected model, and tune hyperparameters using cross-validation.
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualize the performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

## Visualization
- **Categorical Data:** Bar charts and count plots to visualize the distribution of categorical features such as gender and occupation.
- **Numerical Data:** Histograms and box plots to explore the distribution and central tendencies of numerical features like age and depression scores.

## Project Link
You can find the complete analysis and code in the [Depression Dataset Analysis on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/remdilatkse/depression-dataset-analysis).

By following this structured approach, the project not only aims to provide insights into the factors contributing to depression but also offers a potential framework for developing predictive models to assist in early identification and intervention.
